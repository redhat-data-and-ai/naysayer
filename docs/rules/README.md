# 🛡️ Naysayer Rules Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each validation rule implemented in Naysayer. Each rule has its own focused documentation explaining what it validates, when it triggers, and how to resolve common issues.

> **🎯 Quick Navigation**: Find your rule below and click the link for detailed guidance.

## 📚 Available Rules

### 🏢 [Warehouse Rule](WAREHOUSE_RULE.md)
**Validates**: Data product warehouse configurations  
**Triggers on**: `**/product.{yaml,yml}` files with warehouse sections  
**Purpose**: Cost control and budget governance  
**Key behavior**: Auto-approves cost reductions (~$50k/month savings), requires approval for increases

### 🔒 [Service Account Rule](SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RULE.md)
**Validates**: Service account configurations and security policies  
**Triggers on**: `**/*serviceaccount*.{yaml,yml}`, `**/*_astro_*_appuser.{yaml,yml}`  
**Purpose**: Security compliance and identity management  
**Key behavior**: Auto-approves Astro service accounts, requires security review for manual accounts

### 📄 [Metadata Rule](METADATA_RULE.md)
**Validates**: Documentation and metadata files  
**Triggers on**: `**/*.md`, `**/developers.{yaml,yml}`, documentation files  
**Purpose**: Development velocity and documentation quality  
**Key behavior**: Auto-approves all documentation and metadata changes (zero risk)

## 🎯 Quick Problem Resolution

### Common Issues by File Type

| **File Pattern** | **Rule** | **Common Issues** | **Quick Fix** |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| `**/product.{yaml,yml}` | [Warehouse](WAREHOUSE_RULE.md) | Size increases, YAML syntax | Use `XSMALL`/`SMALL`/`MEDIUM`/`LARGE`, validate YAML |
| `**/*serviceaccount*.{yaml,yml}` | [Service Account](SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RULE.md) | Non-Astro accounts, domain violations | Use Astro patterns, @redhat.com emails |
| `**/*.md`, docs files | [Metadata](METADATA_RULE.md) | File access issues | Check file permissions, valid UTF-8 encoding |

## ⚙️ Rule System Overview

### Section-Based Architecture

NAYSAYER uses a **Section-Based Validation Architecture** where rules can target specific sections of files rather than entire files. This provides:

- **🎯 Granular Control**: Rules validate specific YAML sections (e.g., `warehouses`, `service_account.dbt`)
- **⚡ Performance**: Only relevant sections are parsed and validated  
- **🔧 Configurability**: Rules and sections are configured through `rules.yaml`
- **📊 Coverage Tracking**: Ensures all sections are covered by appropriate rules

> **🏗️ Complete Details**: For architecture deep-dive, implementation patterns, and technical details, see:
> - **[Section-Based Architecture Guide](../SECTION_BASED_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete architecture overview
> - **[Rule Creation Guide](../RULE_CREATION_GUIDE.md)** - Implementation guide for developers

### Decision Logic

- **Fail-Fast**: If ANY rule requires manual review, the entire MR needs review
- **Independent**: Each rule evaluates files independently
- **Configurable**: Rules can be enabled/disabled via environment variables

### Rule Categories

| **Category** | **Purpose** | **Examples** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 🏢 **Cost Control** | Prevent unexpected cost increases | Warehouse size validation |
| 🔒 **Security** | Enforce security policies | Service account email validation |
| 📋 **Compliance** | Meet organizational standards | Naming conventions, documentation |
| 🔧 **Configuration** | Ensure valid configurations | YAML syntax, required fields |

## 📊 Rule Status Dashboard

### Active Rules Summary

| **Rule** | **Status** | **Auto-Approval Rate** | **Common Issues** |
|----------|------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 🏢 **Warehouse** | ✅ Active | ~85% | Size increases (15%) |
| 🔒 **Service Account** | ✅ Active | ~70% | Non-Astro accounts (30%) |
| 📄 **Metadata** | ✅ Active | ~100% | File access issues (<1%) |

### Performance Metrics

- **Average rule execution time**: < 3 seconds
- **False positive rate**: < 2%
- **System availability**: 99.9%

## ⚙️ Global Configuration

### Environment Variables

Control rule behavior globally:

```bash
# Enable/disable all rules
RULES_ENABLED=true

# Global timeout for rule execution
RULES_TIMEOUT=30

# Debug logging for all rules
RULES_DEBUG=false

# Maximum file size for processing
RULES_MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880  # 5MB
```

### Per-Rule Configuration

Each rule can be configured independently:

```bash
# Warehouse Rule
WAREHOUSE_RULE_ENABLED=true
WAREHOUSE_ALLOW_SIZE_INCREASES=false
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Universal Solutions

These apply to all rules:

#### YAML Syntax Issues
```bash
# Validate YAML before committing
yamllint your-file.yaml

# Or use online validator
# https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
```

#### File Path Issues
- Check exact file path matches rule patterns
- Verify case sensitivity
- Ensure proper directory structure

#### Permission Issues
- Verify GitLab token has file access
- Check repository permissions
- Contact platform team if persistent

### Getting Debug Information

Enable debug logging to see detailed rule execution:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export RULES_DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Check logs for detailed execution info
kubectl logs -f deployment/naysayer | grep rule_execution
```
